# What We DON'T Want

## Gameplay Exclusions
- **Realistic graphics** - We want stylized, not photorealistic
- **Complex crafting trees** - Keep it simple for MVP
- **Inventory management hell** - No Minecraft-style inventory juggling
- **Slow movement** - Flying should feel good and fast

## Technical Exclusions
- **Standard unoptimized rendering** - Must hit 20k+ FPS
- **Rigid blocky grids** - No Minecraft-style sharp edges
- **Triangle-based grids** - Quads only (Stalberg-style)
- **CPU-bound draw calls** - Use GPU instancing/indirect rendering

## Scope Exclusions (Not MVP)
- **Multiplayer/networking** - Local only for MVP
- **Online features** - No accounts, leaderboards, cloud saves
- **Complex AI behaviors** - Simple AI is fine
- **Procedural world generation** - Hand-crafted test level OK
