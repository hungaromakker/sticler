# Out of Scope for MVP

## Definitely Not Building
1. **Multiplayer networking** - Focus on local gameplay first
2. **User accounts/authentication** - No online features
3. **Level editor** - Hardcoded test levels for now
4. **Story/campaign mode** - Just sandbox testing
5. **Mobile/console ports** - Desktop only
6. **VR support** - Standard display

## Defer to Later Phases
1. **Advanced AI** - Basic AI is sufficient
2. **Multiple weapon types** - One or two base weapons
3. **Cosmetic customization** - Default visuals only
4. **Sound design** - Can add later
5. **Tutorial system** - Assume testers know controls

## Won't Use From sticker_game
- The 2D rendering approach
- The "technical demo" mindset
- Any features that don't feel fun
