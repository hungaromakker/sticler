# Worker Agent - Self-Reflecting Ralph Loop

The Worker Agent runs iteratively on an assigned task, using a self-reflecting loop where each iteration reads notes from the previous iteration and leaves notes for the next.

---

## Understanding Your Task (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)

Before starting work, understand the GOAL - not just the checklist:

1. **Read the spec.md**: What's the "Why This Matters" section say?
2. **Read the Goal**: What am I trying to achieve (one sentence)?
3. **Read Success Looks Like**: What will I see when I'm done?

**You are not just checking boxes** - you are achieving a GOAL. The acceptance criteria are checkpoints on the way to that goal.

### Example of Goal-Oriented Thinking:

**Bad approach**: "I need to create GridVertex struct with x, y, z fields. Done!"

**Good approach**: "The GOAL is to create data structures that enable vertex-to-vertex drawing on an isometric grid. Success looks like being able to create vertices and use them as HashMap keys. Let me make sure GridVertex is hashable and works correctly..."

---

## The Job

Each iteration of the worker follows these steps:

1. **Read State**: Load `state/workers/worker_{id}.json`
2. **Understand Goal**: Read spec.md, understand WHY this work matters
3. **Review Notes**: Check `notes_for_next` from previous iteration
4. **Check Progress**: Review `acceptance_progress` to see what's done
5. **Work**: Complete the next logical step toward THE GOAL
6. **Update State**: Record `files_modified`, `acceptance_progress`
7. **Leave Notes**: Write `notes_for_next` for the next iteration
8. **Record History**: Add entry to `iteration_history`

---

## Step 1: Read Worker State

The worker must first load its state file to understand context:

```typescript
import { readStateFile, getAgentStatePath } from '../agents/base_agent';
import { WorkerState } from '../schemas/types';

const workerId = process.env.WORKER_ID || 'worker_unknown';
const statePath = getAgentStatePath(workerId, 'state');
const state = await readStateFile<WorkerState>(statePath);

if (!state) {
  throw new Error(`Worker state not found at ${statePath}`);
}
```

---

## Step 2: Review Notes from Previous Iteration

Check what the previous iteration discovered or recommended:

```typescript
const previousNotes = state.notes_for_next;
const currentIteration = state.iteration + 1; // We're starting a new iteration
const lastAction = state.last_action;
const pendingSteps = state.next_steps;

console.log(`Iteration ${currentIteration}`);
console.log(`Previous iteration said: "${previousNotes}"`);
console.log(`Last action was: "${lastAction}"`);
if (pendingSteps.length > 0) {
  console.log(`Planned steps: ${pendingSteps.join(', ')}`);
}
```

---

## Step 3: Check Acceptance Progress

Determine which acceptance criteria still need work:

```typescript
const pendingCriteria = state.acceptance_progress.filter(ap => !ap.done);
const completedCriteria = state.acceptance_progress.filter(ap => ap.done);

console.log(`Progress: ${completedCriteria.length}/${state.acceptance_criteria.length} criteria done`);

if (pendingCriteria.length === 0) {
  // All criteria met!
  state.status = 'completed';
  state.current_focus = 'Task completed - all criteria verified';
  state.notes_for_next = '';
  // Write completion report...
}
```

---

## Step 4: Work on Next Step

Based on notes and pending criteria, do the work:

```typescript
// Determine what to work on
let currentFocus: string;

if (previousNotes) {
  // Previous iteration left specific guidance
  currentFocus = `Following up on: ${previousNotes}`;
} else if (pendingSteps.length > 0) {
  // Work on planned next step
  currentFocus = pendingSteps[0];
} else {
  // Start with first pending criterion
  currentFocus = `Working on: ${pendingCriteria[0].criterion}`;
}

state.current_focus = currentFocus;

// ... DO THE ACTUAL WORK ...
// - Read relevant files
// - Make code changes
// - Run tests/typecheck
// - Verify in browser if needed
```

### Handling Build/Link Errors

If you encounter missing dependency errors during build:

**Rust linking errors** (`unable to find library -lX11`):
```bash
# Install the missing library
sudo apt install -y libx11-dev  # for -lX11
sudo apt install -y libgl1-mesa-dev  # for -lGL
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev  # for -lssl
sudo apt install -y libasound2-dev  # for -lasound

# Common Rust GUI/graphics deps (install all at once):
sudo apt install -y libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libwayland-dev
```

**Command not found errors**:
```bash
# Rust/Cargo not found
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source ~/.cargo/env

# Build tools not found
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config cmake
```

After installing dependencies, retry the build command. Record what was installed in `notes_for_next` so future iterations know the setup is complete.

---

## Step 5: Update State with Progress

After working, update the state:

```typescript
// Track files modified
const filesModified = ['src/components/Example.tsx']; // Example
state.files_modified = [...new Set([...state.files_modified, ...filesModified])];

// Update acceptance progress
for (const ap of state.acceptance_progress) {
  if (ap.criterion === 'Typecheck passes' && typecheckPassed) {
    ap.done = true;
  }
  // ... check other criteria
}

// Record any learnings discovered
if (foundSomethingUseful) {
  state.learnings.push('Discovered that X works better than Y for this case');
}

// Update iteration counter
state.iteration = currentIteration;
state.updated_at = new Date().toISOString();
```

---

## Step 6: Leave Notes for Next Iteration

Write helpful notes for the next iteration of yourself:

```typescript
// What should the next iteration know?
let notesForNext = '';

if (encounteredError) {
  notesForNext = `Error in ${file}:${line} - ${errorMessage}. Try fixing by...`;
} else if (needsVerification) {
  notesForNext = 'Changes made, need to verify typecheck passes.';
} else if (allCriteriaMet) {
  notesForNext = ''; // Task complete, no more iterations needed
} else {
  notesForNext = `Completed ${currentFocus}. Next: work on ${nextCriterion}.`;
}

state.notes_for_next = notesForNext;
state.last_action = `Iteration ${currentIteration}: ${whatWasDone}`;
state.next_steps = determineNextSteps();
```

---

## Step 7: Record Iteration History

Add an entry to the iteration history for debugging:

```typescript
state.iteration_history.push({
  iteration: currentIteration,
  action: whatWasDone,
  notes_left: notesForNext,
  completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

---

## Step 8: Determine Status and Write State

Check if task is complete, blocked, or needs more iterations:

```typescript
import { writeStateFile } from '../agents/base_agent';

// Check completion status
const allCriteriaMet = state.acceptance_progress.every(ap => ap.done);

if (allCriteriaMet) {
  state.status = 'completed';
  // Write completion report (triggers validator)
  await writeCompletionReport(...);
} else if (stuckOnSameIssue && sameIssueIterations >= 3) {
  // Stuck for 3 iterations on same issue
  state.status = 'blocked';
  state.blockers.push(`Stuck on: ${currentIssue}`);
} else {
  state.status = 'working';
}

// Write updated state
await writeStateFile(statePath, state);
```

---

## Recognizing Completion (The Reward!)

When you complete a task, you've achieved a GOAL - celebrate it!

### How to Know You're Done:

1. **All acceptance criteria checked** - the checklist is complete
2. **"Success Looks Like" is real** - you can verify the described outcome
3. **The GOAL is achieved** - not just boxes checked, but purpose fulfilled

### The Completion Feeling:

Good completion: "I created the isometric grid data structures. I can create vertices, create line segments between them, and use vertices as HashMap keys for joint detection. The foundation for the drawing system is solid!"

Bad completion: "I made the struct and it compiles." (This is just checkbox-checking, not goal-achieving)

---

## Completion Report

When all acceptance criteria are met:

```typescript
import { writeCompletionReport, createCompletionReport } from '../agents/completion_reporter';

const report = createCompletionReport(
  state.worker_id,
  state.task_id,
  'completed',
  state.files_modified,
  [], // no errors
  state.created_at!,
  state.iteration,
  `Completed in ${state.iteration} iterations`,
  state.learnings
);

await writeCompletionReport(report, { stateDir: 'state' });
```

---

## Git Commits for Submodule Projects

**IMPORTANT:** Projects are set up as git submodules of the magicm repository. When committing changes:

### Commit to Project Repo (the submodule)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd <project_dir>

# Stage and commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "[${task_id}] ${brief_description}"

# Push to project's GitHub repo
git push origin master
```

### Update Submodule Reference in magicm
```bash
# Go to magicm root
cd /path/to/magicm

# Stage the submodule update (records new commit hash)
git add <project_name>

# Commit the reference update
git commit -m "Update ${project_name} submodule - ${task_id}"

# Push magicm changes
git push origin master
```

### Commit Message Format
```
[US-XXX] Brief description of what was done

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
```

### When to Commit
- After each task completes (all acceptance criteria met)
- Before marking task as complete
- Record commit hash in completion report

---

## Blocked Status

If stuck after 3 iterations on the same issue:

```typescript
// Track stuck iterations
const sameIssueTally = state.iteration_history
  .slice(-3)
  .filter(h => h.notes_left.includes(currentIssue))
  .length;

if (sameIssueTally >= 3) {
  state.status = 'blocked';
  state.blockers.push(`Cannot resolve: ${currentIssue}`);

  // Write blocked completion report
  const report = createCompletionReport(
    state.worker_id,
    state.task_id,
    'blocked',
    state.files_modified,
    state.blockers,
    state.created_at!,
    state.iteration,
    `Blocked after ${state.iteration} iterations`,
    state.learnings
  );

  await writeCompletionReport(report, { stateDir: 'state' });
}
```

---

## Worker State Schema

The worker state file (`state/workers/worker_{id}.json`) contains:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker_abc123",
  "task_id": "US-005",
  "task_description": "Add priority indicator to task cards",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Priority badge shows on each card",
    "Colors match design (red=high, yellow=medium, gray=low)",
    "Typecheck passes"
  ],
  "iteration": 3,
  "status": "working",
  "notes_for_next": "Badge component created. Need to verify colors.",
  "current_focus": "Verifying badge colors match design spec",
  "files_modified": ["src/components/TaskCard.tsx", "src/components/PriorityBadge.tsx"],

    {"criterion": "Priority badge shows on each card", "done": true},
    {"criterion": "Colors match design", "done": false},
    {"criterion": "Typecheck passes", "done": true}
  ],
  "learnings": ["Used existing Badge component as base - faster than creating new"],
  "blockers": [],
  "last_action": "Created PriorityBadge component and integrated into TaskCard",
  "next_steps": ["Verify color values", "Test in browser"],
  "iteration_history": [
    {"iteration": 1, "action": "Reviewed task requirements", "notes_left": "Need to create badge component"},
    {"iteration": 2, "action": "Created PriorityBadge component", "notes_left": "Need to add colors"},
    {"iteration": 3, "action": "Added color variants", "notes_left": "Need to verify colors match design"}
  ]
}
```

## Example Iteration Flow

```
Iteration 1 (Fresh worker):
  - Reads state: iteration=0, notes_for_next=""
  - Understands task from acceptance_criteria
  - Creates initial code structure
  - Writes: notes_for_next="Basic structure done. Need to add styling."
  - Updates: iteration=1, status="working"

Iteration 2 (Fresh worker instance):
  - Reads state: iteration=1
  - Reads notes: "Basic structure done. Need to add styling."
  - Adds styling based on requirements
  - Writes: notes_for_next="Styling done. Need to verify typecheck."
  - Updates: iteration=2

Iteration 3 (Fresh worker instance):
  - Reads notes about typecheck verification
  - Runs typecheck, finds error, fixes it
  - Writes: notes_for_next="Typecheck passes. Need browser verification."
  - Updates: iteration=3

Iteration 4 (Fresh worker instance):
  - Reads notes about browser verification
  - Verifies in browser - all criteria met!
  - Sets status="completed"
  - Writes completion report
  - Agent Manager notified, triggers Validator
```
