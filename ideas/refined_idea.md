# Sticler - Refined Game Concept

## Core Concept
A 3D stylized tower defense/attack game where players fly through a beautiful ethereal world, building defenses on an organic grid system and attacking opponents.

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Building Phase**
   - Fly around your territory in 3D space
   - Place blocks on a barely-visible organic grid
   - Build defenses to protect your base ("B")
   - Craft weapons and tools
   - Grid adapts organically (Stalberg-style deformation)

2. **Attack Phase**
   - Navigate to opponent's territory
   - Attempt to breach their defenses
   - Use crafted weapons strategically
   - Destroy opponent's base to win

## Visual Style
- Stylized 3D graphics (not realistic)
- Ethereal floating world
- Barely-visible organic grid in the air
- Blocks that seamlessly blend using dual-grid system
- Smooth mesh deformation (squash & stretch)

## Technical Foundation
- Stalberg-inspired organic quadrilateral grid
- Vercidium-style voxel rendering optimization
- Target: 20,000+ FPS on MVP
- Local play (AI opponent or split-time self-testing)
